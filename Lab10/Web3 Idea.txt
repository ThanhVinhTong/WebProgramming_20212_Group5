Web3 Idea:

Bank Application

Each user will use their Metamask wallet as their account
Our application will have its own native token called FAF token
User will stake a certain amount of token into our application
That amount of token will then be converted to our FAF token
Those FAF token in their account will increase according to our bank interes rate
User can withdrawn their money after that
